Some Future Features I am planning to Add

Crop Variety: Introduce different types of crops with varying growth times, yields, and sell prices. Players can choose which crops to plant based on their preferences and market conditions.

Crop Lifecycle: Implement a more realistic crop lifecycle, including stages such as seed planting, sprouting, growth, flowering, and harvesting. Each stage can have its own visual representation and gameplay mechanics.

Farm Expansion: Allow players to expand their farm by purchasing additional land or unlocking new areas. This can provide more space for crop cultivation, livestock rearing, or building structures like barns and storage facilities.

Livestock Farming: Introduce livestock farming, where players can raise animals such as cows, chickens, and pigs. Players need to manage their feed, health, and production for resources like milk, eggs, and meat.

Farming Equipment: Include a range of farming equipment and machinery that players can purchase and upgrade. Equipment like tractors, harvesters, and irrigation systems can improve efficiency and yield on the farm.

Crop Diseases and Weather Conditions: Introduce challenges such as crop diseases, pests, and unpredictable weather conditions. Players need to implement preventive measures, use pesticides, or take appropriate actions to mitigate the impact on their crops.

Market System: Implement a dynamic market system where crop prices fluctuate based on supply and demand. Players can sell their crops at different prices depending on market conditions and make strategic decisions on when to sell for maximum profit.

Quests and Objectives: Add a quest system with various objectives and challenges for players to complete. Quests can range from delivering crops to specific locations, helping neighboring farms, or participating in farming competitions.

Farm Customization: Allow players to personalize and customize their farm's appearance, including choosing different themes, decorations, and landscaping options.

Seasons and Events: Introduce seasonal changes and special events throughout the year. Each season can have unique effects on crops and farm activities, while events like festivals and holidays can offer special rewards and interactions.
