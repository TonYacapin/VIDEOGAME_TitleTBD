Farming Game C#


Some Future Features I am planning to Add

Crop Variety: Introduce different types of crops with varying growth times, yields, and sell prices. Players can choose which crops to plant based on their preferences and market conditions.

Farm Expansion: Allow players to expand their farm by purchasing additional land . This can provide more space for crop cultivation, livestock rearing, or building structures like barns and storage facilities.

Livestock Farming: Introduce livestock farming, where players can raise animals such as cows, chickens, and pigs. Players need to manage their feed, health, and production for resources like milk, eggs, and meat.
